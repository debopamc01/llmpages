Brandon Sanderson's Short Story:

Ashravan’s eyes shimmered with an unnatural glow, remnants of a battle long fought within his soul. After Shai’s restorative magic mended his broken body, he stood at the edge of the cliff, gazing at the horizon where the last shadows of night clung stubbornly.

The world around him was silent, save for the distant cry of a lone hawk. He remembered the chaos—the betrayal, the losses, and the moment of redemption that Shai had gifted him. Yet, beneath that relief, a nagging sense of foreboding persisted.

Suddenly, an ancient voice echoed in his mind, whispering secrets of the gods and the future of the realms. He realized he had a new purpose: to protect the fragile peace and confront the impending darkness. The past had scarred him, but now, with renewed strength, he vowed to become a beacon of hope.

As dawn approached, Ashravan clenched his fists, feeling the surge of power coursing through his veins. The dramatic climax loomed—a storm of chaos and hope intertwined—calling him to action. The story would continue, but for now, he stood resilient, ready to face whatever fate had in store.
